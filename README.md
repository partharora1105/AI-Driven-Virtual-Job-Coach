# AI-Driven-Virtual-Job-Coach
An AI-driven virtual job coach is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence algorithms to provide guidance and support to individuals seeking employment or trying to advance their careers. The virtual job coach may take the form of an avatar on a video call or even chatbot or a voice assistant that interacts with users through our app.

The virtual job coach is designed to offer personalized advice and support to users based on their individual needs, interests, and qualifications. It may help users develop their resumes and cover letters, search for job openings, and prepare for interviews. The coach may also offer training and educational resources to help users acquire new skills or enhance their existing ones.
